                <h2>WEB</h2>
                <p>Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first 
                implementation of what he called"literate programming": the ideathat one could 
                create software as works ofliterature, by embedding sourcecode inside descriptive 
                text, rather than the reverse (asis common practice in mostprogramming 
                languages), in an order that isconvenient for exposition tohuman readers, rather 
                than in the order demanded by thecompiler.</p>
                
                <p>Web consists of two secondaryprograms: TANGLE, which producescompilable Pascal
                code from the source texts, andWEAVE, which producesnicely-formatted, printable
                documentation using TeX.</p>
                
                <p>CWEB is a version of Web forthe C programming language, whilenoweb is a 
                separate literate programmingtool, which is inspired by Web(as reflected in the 
                name) and which is languageagnostic.</p>
                
                <p>The most significant programswritten in Web are TeX andMetafont. Modern TeX 
                distributions use another programWeb2C to convert Web source to C</p>
